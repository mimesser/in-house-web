                        token. This authenticates the user&rsquo;s device (absent of any corrupt obfuscation). Given
                        authentication, the Site&rsquo;s server-side can validate if a user has certain rights, for

                        as soon as the user closes their session (closes the app / closes the browser window), then that
                        user will be forgotten.
