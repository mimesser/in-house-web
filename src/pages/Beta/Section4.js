            Will my boss know it's me?

            No. We don't take names or even emails.

         <Heading L2>
            How can I know it's just me & my team talking?
         </Heading>
         <Content L1>
            Because we use <em>"minks"</em> - patented insider password
            questions using your shared knowledge to verify you.

         <Heading L2>
            Can everyone see our feedback?
         </Heading>
         <Content L1>
            No. Only bosses & <em>"insiders"</em> (who can answer your
            job's 'mink') can get access so opinions stay IN-HOUSE.

         <Heading L2>
            Does my boss control this?
         </Heading>
         <Content L1>
            No. Organizations can't control or dictate anything.
            They're only given access after insiders start talking.
