      <h2>2. USING THE SITE</h2>
      <h3>A.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Eligibility</h3>
      <p>
         <span>
            To access or use the Site, you must be 18 years of age or older and have the requisite power and authority
            to enter into these Terms.&nbsp; You may not access or use the Site if you are a competitor of ours or if we
            have previously banned you from the Site or closed your account.&nbsp;&nbsp;
         </span>
      </p>

      <h3>B.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Permission to Use the Site</h3>
      <p>
         <span>
            We grant you permission to use the Site subject to the restrictions in these Terms.&nbsp; Your use of the
            Site is at your own risk, including the risk that you might be exposed to text, images, photos, audio,
            video, location data, and all other forms of data or communication, which we refer to as &ldquo;
         </span>
         <strong>Content</strong>
         <span>
            ,&rdquo; that is offensive, indecent, inaccurate, objectionable, or otherwise inappropriate.&nbsp;&nbsp;
         </span>
      </p>
      <h3>C.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Site Availability</h3>
      <p>
         <span>
            The Site may be modified, updated, interrupted, suspended or discontinued at any time without notice or
            liability.&nbsp;&nbsp;
         </span>
      </p>
      <h3>D.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Authentication</h3>
      <p>
         <span>
            The Site does not require a registered account for a user to participate. Instead we use a simple device
            authentication to recognize the same user to manage their preferences and voting history.&nbsp;
         </span>
      </p>
      <p>
         <span>The process is as follows: </span>
         <span>A user visits In-House on the web, Android, or iOS.&nbsp; We call this the </span>
         <em>
            <span>client</span>
         </em>
         <span> (or front-end). If you are a returning user, you will have a unique User ID (called a </span>
         <em>
            <span>token</span>
         </em>
         <span>) within a </span>
         <em>
            <span>cookie</span>
         </em>
         <span>
            {' '}
            or within your device&rsquo;s local storage, stored on the Site&rsquo;s client side. The Site&rsquo;s client
            side makes a request to our Site&rsquo;s server side (or back-end) to pass along this token. The server
            checks the database for a corresponding voting account for this token. This authenticates the user&rsquo;s
            device (absent of any corrupt obfuscation). Given authentication, the Site&rsquo;s server-side can validate
            if a user has certain rights, for example - if they are an insider of a certain house.&nbsp; This is called{' '}
         </span>
         <em>
            <span>authorization</span>
         </em>
         <span>
            . If the token is invalid, or if it is a new user (who does not have a token), then the server will generate
            a new account and send a new token to the user&rsquo;s device for the client side to save.
         </span>
      </p>
      <p>
         <span>
            If a user disables cookies or local storage on their device, the Site will function as is, but as soon as
            the user closes their session (closes the app / closes the browser window), then that user will be
            forgotten.
         </span>
      </p>
      <h3>E.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Registered User Accounts</h3>
      <p>
         <span>
            You must create an account and provide certain personal information about yourself in order to use some of
            the advanced features that are offered through the Site.&nbsp; This personal information may include:
